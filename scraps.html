    <h1>Why do local elections matter?</h1>
    <p>Why are local elections so important? According to an <a href="https://medium.com/@RockTheVote/why-local-elections-matter-6e7ba4545c00">article</a> published on local elections in 2017, there are a few key reasons:
    </p>
    <h2>Local elections make decisions that will directly affect your life</h2>
    <p>Including but not limited to:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Funding for police departments</li>
        <li>Public education curricula and budgets</li>
        <li>Availability and cost of public transportation</li>
        <li>Tax rates for small businesses in Chinatown or Greenlake</li>
        <li>And so much more...</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  <h2>Local elections can create change quickly, while the federal government takes time</h2>
  <p>While change most certainly occurs at the national level, it typically takes months or even years for federal policies to trickle down to the state or local level. 
         However, the results of local elections can create tangible changes that are almost immediately visible in local communities. 
         Several policies, including marriage equality, civil rights, and environmental policy started at the state or local levels before working their way up to a national scale. 
         In turbulent times like these, voting in local elections and holding elected officials accountable can spur the local government into action, creating ripple effects on a national level. 
  </p>
  <h2>Your vote matters!</h2>
  <p>Since only about 1 in 5 voters participate in local elections, your vote will make even more of a difference. In 2017, King County hit a record low in voter turnout, with only 37% of registered voters participating in the November general election.
         With such a low turnout, every vote becomes infinitely more important, and a one vote difference could end up determining local officials and referendums.

            <ul>
                <li>People don’t think their vote matters</li>
                <li>People don’t understand how local officials affect their lives</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="column">
          <h2>Logistics</h2>
           <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Registration issues</li>
                <li>Too busy or schedule conflicts</li>
                <li>Lack of information</li>
                <li>Didn’t know a local election was happening</li>
                <li>Illness or disability </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
       </div>
    </div>
  <p>In order to improve voter turnout, we must address both the logistical and connective issues, and make local elections more accessible to everyone.</p>

# Mission Statement

The Informed Voter Project is a Seattle Based nonpartisan nonprofit group working to improve voter turnout and access to mayoral, city council, and other local elections to create systemic change. The group seeks to address various barriers to voting, including a lack information, inconvenient polling locations and times, and confusion regarding the voting process itself.
Our vision is a thriving democracy, one where voters actively participate in their local communities.

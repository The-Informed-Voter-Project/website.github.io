### Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue
Proposition No. 1
Authorization for Continuation of Benefit Charges
Shall Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue be authorized to continue voter-authorized benefit charges each year for six consecutive years, not to exceed an amount equal to sixty percent of its operating budget, and be prohibited from imposing an additional property tax under RCW 52.16.160?

Yes No

#### Explanatory statement

Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue provides emergency medical, and fire protection service in King and Kittitas Counties. The Board of Commissioners is requesting that voters approve the continuation of the existing benefit charge to replace the expiring six year benefit charge approved by the voters in 2014.
A benefit charge is not a property tax but is a user fee designed to allocate the cost of the services provided by the District in reasonable proportion to the measurable benefit a property receives. The benefit charge will be based on a standard industry accepted formula that takes into consideration fire flows, the square footage of structures and the type of structures. If the benefit charge is approved the District’s statutory tax authority is reduced by $.50 per thousand of assessed valuation.
The Board of Commissioners has determined that a benefit charge established in conjunction with a lower level of property taxes provides the fairest, most stable, reliable and cost effective method for financing the operations of the District and maintaining a satisfactory level of services.
The proposition requests voters to authorize the benefit charge to be collected for six years from 2021 through 2026. The benefit charge will be established by November 30th of each year for collection the following year. Prior to establishing the benefit charge each year, the Board of Commissioners will hold a public hearing and each year property owners will have the right to petition for adjustments in the amount of the benefit charge.

### Mountain View Fire and Rescue
Proposition No. 1
Levy of General Tax for Maintenance and Operations

The Board of Mountain View Fire and Rescue adopted Resolution No. 20-535 concerning a proposition to adequately finance maintenance and operation costs. This proposition provides for the support of fire protection and emergency medical services, facilities, maintenance, staffing and operations by authorizing the District to levy the following excess taxes:

| Collection Year | Approximate <br/> Levy Rate/$1,000 <br/> Assessed Value | Levy Amount |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|2021|$0.30|$965,000|
|2022|$0.30|$965,000|
|2023|$0.30|$965,000|
|2024|$0.30|$965,000|

Should this proposition be approved?

Yes No

#### Explanatory statement

If approved by the voters, Mountain View Fire & Rescue will be authorized to collect a Maintenance and Operations levy in the sum of $965,000 per year for a temporary four-year period. The District estimates that the associated tax levy rate each year will be approximately $0.30 per $1,000 of assessed property valuation. This excess levy will be in addition to the District’s regular tax levy.
Call volumes increased almost six percent last year. The District is limited to a one percent revenue increase by state law, and it’s not keeping up with the demand for service. More calls mean added wear and tear on emergency equipment. Certain emergency apparatus needs to be replaced before becoming unreliable. Some fire stations also require major repairs and maintenance to extend their usable lives.
These capital items are too expensive to fund through the District’s daily operating levy without cutting emergency service levels. This M&O levy will allow the District to pay cash for these purchases thereby avoiding interest charges. The District also anticipates a portion of the M&O levy will help cover unanticipated costs associated with COVID-19, such as personal protective gear for firefighters and medical equipment.
The M&O levy would cost the owner of a $384,000 home (an average for the area) approximately $9.60 a month. The levy would expire in four years, while the capital items will last for 15-30 years. More information on the M&O levy can be found on the Fire District’s website at www.mvfire.org.

#### Statement in favor

As residents of the Mountain View Fire and Rescue we are fortunate to have highly skilled, well-trained emergency personnel and fire fighters. The Fire District is asking for a Maintenance and Operations Levy to update protective gear and apparatus. 
Our fire stations are a community investment and some stations require major repairs and maintenance to extend their usable lives. A fire engine and a water tender need to be replaced before they become unreliable. Other critical equipment updates needed are defibrillators and self-contained breathing apparatus. The pandemic has shown how important personal protective equipment is. These items are essential to saving lives, but are too expensive to fund through the regular fire levy, which pays for daily operations. 
The proposed M&O Levy would cost the average homeowner around $10 per month. It would expire in four years, but the investments will last 15-30 years. 
Our Fire District has a long history of only asking us for help when it is needed. In fact, this is only the second time they’ve requested additional revenue in 66 years. They are there 24/7 to help us.  We need to do our part. Please vote yes.

### South King Fire & Rescue
Proposition No. 1
Levy of General Tax $3,750,000 for Maintenance and Operations

The Board of Commissioners of South King Fire & Rescue adopted Resolution No. 573 concerning a proposition to finance maintenance and operation expenses. This proposition, if approved, will authorize the District to levy, without regard to the limitations of chapter 84.52 RCW, a property tax upon all taxable property within the district of:

| Collection Year | Approximate <br/> Levy Rate/$1,000 <br/> Assessed Value | Levy Amount |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|2021|$0.19|$3,750,000|
|2022|$0.18|$3,750,000|
|2023|$0.17|$3,750,000|
|2024|$0.16|$3,750,000|

to be used for maintenance and operations and increase the current level of fire services and emergency medical services. Should this proposition be approved?

Yes No

#### Explanatory statement

South King Fire and Rescue, serving the citizens of Greater Federal Way and Des Moines, is placing an excess levy proposition on the August 4th, 2020 ballot. This proposition will authorize the fire district to collect $3.75 million annually, at an approximate rate of $0.19 per $1,000 of assessed valuation for the first year, for a four-year period covering 2021 through 2024. The proposition is a replacement to the expiring levy, and is presented to allow voters the opportunity to maintain current fire department services and personnel. This is known as a Maintenance & Operations Levy (M&O levy).
Voters approved in 2012, and again in 2016, an M&O levy. The fire district depends on the M&O levy to augment regular property tax revenues. Restoring the 2017 levy rate of .19 per $1,000 of assessed valuation will allow the fire district to collect an additional $1 million per year for 4 years. These funds will be used to reinstate the fire district's capital improvement plan for the timely replacement of aging equipment.
The District's Board of Commissioners has determined that this proposition is necessary to maintain an effective level of service and to reinstate the capital improvement plan which has been frozen since the last recession. Rejection of this proposition would lead to reductions in service levels, the layoff of fire department personnel including firefighters, potential elimination of special services to the community, delays in the replacement of emergency equipment, and similar cutbacks.

#### Statement in favor

South King Fire & Rescue (SKFR) needs your support to replace the expiring Maintenance and Operations (M&O) Levy. The M&O Levy is a funding measure previously supported by voters in 2012 and 2016 to maintain essential fire district services. During this time, SKFR has maintained helpful, professional service with rapid growth in population, development, and call volumes that now exceed 20,000 emergency responses each year.
Replacement of Expiring Levy. Using the 2017 M&O levy rate of .19 cents per $1,000 of assessed valuation provides the personnel and equipment needed for this M&O levy period.  The homeowner of a $400,000 home will pay just over $6 dollars a month ($1.60 more than currently paying). 
Support Fire. This levy funds a variety of necessary expenditures that maintain staffing and replace outdated equipment, ensuring quality fire, life safety, and emergency responses. Without this critical funding SKFR would be forced to reduce resources that support the community and postpone equipment replacements.
Vote Yes! The essential nature of SKFR’s work is more visible in this infectious disease environment, where firefighter/EMTs perform skillfully on the front lines.  They serve us well.  We must continue to support SKFR to maintain a strong and healthy community.

           <div class="p-name">
            The Informed Voter Project is a nonpartisan nonprofit that strives to create lasting, systemic changes. 
            We aim to inspire change at the state and local levels by increasing voter turnout and participation in local elections. 
            To spark this change, we plan to address both the logistical and connective barriers to voting, reminding constituents of the power behind their vote.

       <h1>Our Solution</h1>
       <div class="p-name">
           In order to address both the connective and logistical issues that affect constituents, we have developed a personalized mobile app that notifies voters of upcoming elections, 
           describes the candidates and referendums on the ballot, and explains how issues on the ballot impact specific individuals.

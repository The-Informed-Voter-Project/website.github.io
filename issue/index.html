            The United States has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the world
          </h1>
                <div class="pe">
                   In 2016, only 60% of eligible voters participated in the presidential election, a number far behind the 80-90% turnout rates seen in countries like Australia, Belgium, and Chile. 
                   Voter turnout is even lower in state and local elections. Mayoral elections average a 26% voter turnout, and in many cities, mayors are elected with single-digit turnouts. 
                   The low turnout in local elections is especially concerning, as local elections are often the first gateway to creating lost lasting systemic change. 
                    Seattle is no stranger to low turnout, with only a 40% of eligible voters participating in the most recent mayoral election and only 50% voting in the 2019 city council election.
